# Procedural macros for lv2-ui

This crate includes several produral macros used by the [lv2-ui](https://crates.io/crates/lv2-ui) crate.

## Documentation

The original LV2 API (in the `C` programming language) is documented by ["the LV2 book"](https://lv2plug.in/book/). This book is in the process of being translated to Rust along with the development of `rust-lv2` [(link)](https://janonard.github.io/rust-lv2-book/) and describes how to properly use `rust-lv2`.
